//	Description: The program uses functions to Input, Calculate and then Print an itemized catering bill for a customer
//	             based on the number of Adults & Children, the cost of Each meal for An Adult & Child, the cost of desert,
//               the Tax & tip rate - and Room fees if applicable.
